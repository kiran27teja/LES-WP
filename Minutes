1.3.4	Summary of Meeting with Department of Energy Management (DEM) 
May 05, 2023 
LES: Kiran Sabbineni, Randall Nottingham, Kamsing Phosalath, Viengnakhone Lavongvilay
DEM: Ms. Louvanny Sivannavong, Sisaby Chantasombath, Lampanh Bousawai, Dona Soulivathai, Syvang Xayavong, Houmpanh Vongphachanh. 
Discussions: 
The purpose of this meeting was to discuss the assistance LES can provide DEM in developing the infrastructure inspection program.  
•	Mr. Houmpanh Vongphachanh, Deputy director general of DEM, introduced his team and provided an overview of the current infrastructure inspection procedures.
•	DEM is responsible for conducting design reviews, and inspections during the pre-commissioning, construction, and operation phases of all projects.
•	The Laos technical standards specify DEM’s role in inspecting the substation and Transmission lines. However, the existing standards do not have details of the scope and checklists of inspections. 
•	Mr. Houmpanh requested LES’ assistance with developing the manuals and check lists for Transmission line and Substation inspections and, ToRs for the basic design of Substations and Transmission lines.
•	The DEM would also require technical support for the review and amendment of existing Lao Electrical standards and Government planning. 
•	Mr. Houmpanh requested LES’ support for the inspection and collection of operational and technical data on the condition of Assets, Power Generation facilities, Transmission lines, and Substations. 
Key Messages	DEM requested LES’ support on a range of issues from infrastructure inspections to the development of technical standards and guidelines.        
Challenge	There is currently very limited information on the role and scope of DEM in reviewing designs and project inspections. The Lao technical and Electrical standards document does not clearly specify EdL and DEM’s roles and responsibilities. This will need to be clarified in follow on consultations with DEM and EdL.

1.3.5	Summary of Meeting with EdL 
May 05, 2023 
LES: Kiran Sabbineni, Randall Nottingham, Kamsing Phosalath, Viengnakhone Lavongvilay
EdL: Alignakone Saignasane, Daosamai, Kanthanachuckv, Inthapone P, Thanomsak.
Discussions: 
The purpose of this meeting was to support EdL in coverting the non-PSS/E data into a PLEXOS compatible template.  
•	Based on the discussions with the Energy Exemplar team, the PSS/E model data can be directly ported to PLEXOS through the raw files.
•	The non-PSS/E data, such as the hydrological and load profiles will need to be converted into a format that can be read by PLEXOS and indirectly imported to supplement the PSS/E model data.
•	Energy Exemplar team provided a CSV template showing the essential and optional data needed for base case modeling in PLEXOS. 
•	Since majority of energy generation in Laos is Hydro dependent, parameters like storage volume and flow rate were identified as priorities. 
•	A few issues with the regional and unit codes were set up on PSS/E were also identified and a rectification plan was discussed.
•	The PSS/E model has 145 nodes and 148 generator units. Since this is a large amount of data, EdL will identify a smaller sub system within Laos to model a pilot grid. This can then be expanded to the complete national grid at a later stage. 
Key Messages	EdL will prioritize gathering and reformatting the non PSS/E data for Hydro Generation, Transmission lines and load profiles.        
Challenge	The electric grid in Laos is not a single synchronous system. There are multiple subsystems either as export dedicated Transmission systems or connected to one of the neighboring countries. Selecting a regional network for modelling may not represent the overall characteristics of the Laos grid.  
Actions	EdL to populate the Hydrological data into the PLEXOS data template and select a subsystem to build a base case for training.  
Significance	This meeting helped figure out a methodology to import non-PSS/E data into the PLEXOS data template.

EdL: Daosamai, Kanthanachuckv, Inthapone P, Thanomsak.
Energy Exemplar: Mark Dolan, Nusrat Prova, Hai Nguyen
Discussions: 
This meeting was a workshop to convert the hydrological, load and Transmission line data into a PLEXOS compatible format.  
•	The Substation and nodal data in PSS/E have regional codes specified in the model but the Transmission line data has no associated regional codes in PSS/E. This will need to be developed manually in PLEXOS.
•	The latest full year hydrological data EdL has for flow and volume is 2021. For building the base case, the team will use the minimum and maximum values recorded in 2021 and use the last recorded value for 2021 as the initial value for long term expansion planning.
•	The volumes will be specified for Reservoir based generation facilities. Only the waterway flow data will be populated for run off river projects. 
•	EdL models generators located outside the country as slack buses. This may continue to be the case in PLEXOS as the specifications and ratings of these generators are unavailable. 
•	The Energy Exemplar team confirmed that data transfer from PSS/E to PLEXOS is expected to be seamless. However, EdL will need to prepare the non-PSS/E data in the template that was provided. 
Key Messages	EdL has most of the essential data required for building a base model in PLEXOS. LES will provide support in getting this into the PLEXOS compatible format by May 11, 2023. 
Challenge	The load profiles available with EdL are in different frequencies for each subsystem. The data will have to be aggregated for each region with a common frequency. 
Actions	•	EdL to work on populating the load profile data.
•	LES to develop a data template to develop regional codes for Transmission lines.
Significance	The key parameters and metrics required for the PLEXOS base case were identified and planned in consultation with Energy Exemplar during this meeting.

1.3.7	Summary of Meeting with EdL distribution (VT-1) 
May 09, 2023 
LES: Kiran Sabbineni, Kamsing Phosalath, Viengnakhone Lavongvilay
EdL: Vassana Phetlamphanh (Manager, EdL Distribution, VT-1), Chantang Dethvongpanh, Korlakan Phiavong
Discussions: 
The purpose of this meeting was to introduce the USAID-LES program and discuss support EdL’s distribution needs to improve operations and reduce losses.  
•	The EdL distribution team is part of the Heads of ASEAN Power utility Authorities (HAPUA) program for regional cooperation with 10 other national grids in the region.
•	The HAPUA conference this year formed several working groups and the EdL distribution’s goals for the current year are:
o	Improvements to Asset Management
o	Improving Distribution Reliability and loss reduction
o	Developing a smart grid road map
•	The Vientiane 1 (VT-1) distribution branch is responsible for four districts, providing electricity to 159 villages.
•	The distribution system has 52 feeders with 191,219 connected customers.
•	Majority of the distribution system is not integrated into the SCADA system and the status of outages and faults is monitored by field reporting and manual data logging.
•	Through the field reporting the distribution office performs a data-based distribution system planning, keeping track of several performance metrics. 
•	The VT-1 branch does not have a real time or an accurate estimate of the number of customers connected per feeder. This prevents them from tracking reliability metrics.  
•	With the distribution network mostly concentrated in urban Vientiane, the average length per MV feeder is 40 kilometers. 
•	The total distribution losses in VT-1 for 2022 were 9.1 % with 5.6% technical and 4.1% non-technical losses.
•	EdL’s 2023 target for VT-1 is to reduce the total distribution to 7.79%
•	Of the 52 feeders in VT-1 only 6 feeders are equipped with auto reclosers. The resultant lack of instant fault clearing is leading to longer outages.
Key Messages	The EdL’s VT-1 distribution team needs assistance with CYMDIST licenses, smart meters and advanced testing and monitoring equipment . 
Challenge	None at this stage. 
Actions	•	EdL VT-1 team to prepare a list of items that they would like assistance with.
•	LES to organize a follow up meeting with VT-1.

1.3.9	Summary of Meeting with EdL distribution (VT-II) 
May 10, 2023 
LES: Kiran Sabbineni, Kamsing Phosalath, Viengnakhone Lavongvilay
EdL: Phantasamone Vantha, Phattra Savik, Vannaphone Sivilay, Phoun, Thavisith Sisuvlath
Discussions: 
The purpose of this meeting was to introduce the USAID-LES program and discuss supporting EdL’s VT-II branch’s distribution needs to improve operations and reduce losses.  
•	The director of the VT-II branch introduced the leads of each district and provided an overview of the grid under VT-II management. 
•	VT-II distribution network has 192,854 customers. However, the number of customers per feeder has not been mapped out yet. 
•	The main issues faced by the VT-II branch are outages and under voltages due to the long and radial distribution MV feeders. 
•	The SAIFI for 2022 is 5.43 and the SAIDI is 25.85. These values were based on an estimated number of customers per feeder and are expected to change once the customers are mapped to all the feeders. 
•	The technical and non-technical loss figures 10.24% for VT-II. The target losses for 2023 is 7.75%.
•	The leads of the five districts under VT-II gave presentations on key issues in their networks.
Key Messages	The issues faced by VT-II are very different from the ones observed on VT-I. VT-II’s loads are distributed in a wider area and there is a shortage of Reactive power compensation needed for large loads on long radial lines.  
Challenge	The VT-II team is relying on the CYMDIST model recommendations for the RPC sizing and placement. However, a preliminary calculation of the loads and Power factor values suggests that the RPC components are not sized and placed optimally. This will need to be investigated further during follow-up discussions.  
Actions	•	EdL VT-I1 team to prepare a list of items that they would like assistance with.
•	LES to organize a follow up meeting with VT-1I.
Significance	This meeting helped provide a greater understanding of EdL’s VT-II distribution network operator and the challenges they are facing.
